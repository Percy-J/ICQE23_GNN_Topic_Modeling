3,1,"Desktop","Oh no, there isn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7,1,"Desktop","Because Mr. Jones shot an intruder, right?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

3,1,"Desktop","OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9,1,"Desktop","So maybe so, maybe Mr. Jones didn't know it was him or something because.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

4,6,"Desktop","So by inference, what do you think that? 4 5 PM on Thursday. This is 4:00 PM and 7:00 AM. That means it cannot be Thursday. It must be either Wednesday or Friday, which had no plans coming up. So who else was flying?",1,1,1,0,1,0,0

3,6,"Desktop","Oh wait, wait, but here's the reason Albert Greenbags waited in the airport for 16 hours. So could it be that he waited and then he drove?",1,1,1,0,1,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Hmm.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Ah, I think so. During the waiting time there, because there is no plane so that he waited for 16 hours.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","OK, so he would have been.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","four pm to  seven pm",1,1,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","So there was definitely flights on Thursday. There were no plane rides, possibly on Wednesday or Friday. And you have to wait. So he flew Friday afternoon.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","ohh. Yeah, that that is 16 hours. From 4:00 PM to 7:00 AM, that is 16 hours.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0

3,6,"Desktop","Maybe we can figure it out what time he. He is well. He took his flight. So he arrived on Friday noon to Mexico City, right?",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","But he waited.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

4,6,"Desktop","Hang on, let's go back to what we're supposed to be doing here so we have three questions we need to answer. Who robbed the bank? Who supplied the key, and who supplied the weapon? I think the key is probably the easiest one, and then we can deal with the dynamite. Then we can go back to the person.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1
3,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","So. Let's talk about the key. So we know that we have a front door key. And we have a vault key, correct?",0,0,0,0,1,0,1
6,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Hmm.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","And Albert the president had the key to the vault",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","And he, yes, he also had the key to the front door.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Right?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
6,6,"Desktop","But there was another person who had the key to the front door.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","You have to keep it.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Oh, so it's the same, right?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","So let me repeat the first clue from my side. Margaret often borrow the key to the front door from the president to open the. So most likely Margaret opened the front door. From the key that she took from the president. So as far as I'm concerned, there's no there's no wrongdoing by. Yeah, in that sense by Margaret, she often opens the front door, which is fine. So Albert greenbags is the only person who had the key to involve. The only person is. And based on this, this network diagram, nobody else had key to the vault Does anybody disagree?",1,1,1,1,1,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Umm",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
6,6,"Desktop","You know what?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Just one second. So here we have a vault. That is what it was blasted open, right? So with no keys, OK",1,1,1,0,1,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Sure. Yeah. The key is this. Yeah. So it's quite likely that our dear mr. greenbags, who had the key on him and is the only person who had the key.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","No, that's cool, yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Well, but then.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Yeah, but why would you blow it up if you have the key to the vault?",1,1,0,0,1,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","But who who blew the door?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","So the dynamite was stolen and was blast used to blast open the vault, right?",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","And it was Howard who was it was in charge of the dynamite. Who said that? A hippie?",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","OK, so we need to find the the dynamite player.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
4,6,"Desktop","Stole it. Yeah, the dynamite supply is a construction company.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","So could it be this this guy or wait wait see?",0,0,1,0,1,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","But he claimed that a hippie sorry melody was yours, right? A hippie was hanging around on Wednesday afternoon.",1,0,0,0,1,1,0
2,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","At the construction company, was it?",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Uh, that is not my clue.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Ohh, whose clue was it for the hippie? Could you describe that again, please?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
6,6,"Desktop","Oh, it was mine. Uh, no, the hippie type person hang around the bank was my clue. And a lot of dynamite was stolen from the construction.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","OK, so as far as we're concerned, Mr. Howard Ellington, he claims that a hippie was standing in front of a construction company on Wednesday afternoon and at the same time the dynamite was also stolen. But nobody else can corroborate that so the hippie was carrying $500.00 when he was caught. I don't have the time or day for when he was caught. Does anybody have the time of day where Dirsey flowers was apprehended? Ignore it.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","No.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","No.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","OK, and uh, what's this about staying at home? We have a Dirsey flowers or staying at home between Thursday night to Friday morning, right?",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Hmm yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Umm",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,6,"Desktop","And the robbery was identified Friday.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","So Thursday night. Friday morning so the chances are the hippie did not steal the dynamite. It's most likely based on the evidence Howard Ellington actually took the dynamite and blew up the vault So the problem with this experiment is I don't know which key we're talking about. So if we're talking about the vault key, then it should be Albert greenbags. Greenbags. If we're talking about the front door, again it's Albert greenbags, right? But the janitor had access to the front door Ying do you want to clarify which key you are looking for?",1,1,1,0,1,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","So.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","OK. So I think you're talking about the vault keys, so let's just say Albert greenbags had the vault key and he supplied that and quite likely the what's this guy's name. Howard Ellington was the one who supplied the dynamite.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0
6,6,"Desktop","But the vault was blasted open, right? So they don't really need the vault key. It's the front door one I feel.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Uh, that. Umm? That's true. So who supplied the? Key to the front door.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","But the yeah, but this president. He also had the key to the front door. So maybe he supplied.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","And the janitor.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0
6,6,"Desktop","And.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","So what does the janitor got to do with the front door? Do we remember?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","All these this is. The clue",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Janitor and the president of the bank had the key to the front door.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","The.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","To the front door, do we have the name of the janitor?",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Yeah, we had, uh, I think like this this guy was.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Ohh OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Or this guy? OK, got it, so there's a lot of claims about Elwood Smith.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Umm",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Saw him running at 11:00 PM. Does the. Because this thing is getting. Yeah, I think we're going to have to make a assumption. A few assumptions then. I. I'm just going to say it. That uh, Albert supplied the key. Uh, and what's his name? Howard Ellington supplied the dynamite and the person who robbed the bank. What do we think? Let's give it 2 minutes to think about who robbed the bank.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1
2,6,"Desktop","For the bank, there are two person one is Dirsey Flowers and another is Elwood Smith. So I think.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Yeah. I I don't like. I don't like Dirsey flower. I don't like Anastasia wallflower. Let's call it my my intuition.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Yeah, and this person Elwood Smith. He ran from the bank so maybe he's a person why he ran from the bank.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","So. Umm",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Here you see. The so Anastasia. bought beads but. I think Ben said that.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0
4,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","When police stop I want yeah so.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1
4,6,"Desktop","500 only so I I believe this is a completely unrelated.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0
3,6,"Desktop","Yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,6,"Desktop","Yeah, so I think it's either Albert. Howard or  Elwood. And we've got this lady here.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
6,6,"Desktop","I think the one who supplied the keys is Margaret. Because Elwood's presence was confirmed by the airlines like he was present.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0
2,6,"Desktop","Ah.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,6,"Desktop","So he would not have been there to supply the keys, he was the person who had keys and the other person was this Margaret.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0
